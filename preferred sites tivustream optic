/*
	Boost(0) is a no-op ranking wise, but since we discard all non-matching
	this will make sure that our queries only search in the sites we want.
	If we had specified a boost other than 0 for each site, then our queries
	would be significantly slower.

	Likewise the Site("|example.com|") pattern (note the |) allows us to
	significantly speedup the queries.

	This way we can specify a lot of sites we only want our searches to match against
	but still have fast queries.
